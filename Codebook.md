This is a a code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

In order to clean up the data through R script, in run_analysis.R:
It merges the training and the test sets to create one data set as "alldata".
It extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, which is listed in List1 at the end of this file.
It labels the data set with descriptive variable names according to the features listed in 'features.txt'.
It creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject as "tb2".

List1:
